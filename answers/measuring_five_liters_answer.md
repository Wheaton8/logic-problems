# Measuring Five Liters Answer

Follow the following steps

1) Fill up the four liter jar with 4 liters of water from the spigot
2) Pour from the four liter jar into the three liter jar, filling the three 
liter jar, so that 3 liters of water are in the three liter jar and 1 liter of 
water remains in the four liter jar
3) Dump out the water from the three liter jar
4) Pour the 1 liter or water in the four liter jar into the three liter jar
5) Fill up the four liter jar with 4 liters of water

You now have 1 liter of water in the three liter jar and 4 liters of water in 
the four liter jar for a total of 5 liters of water.
