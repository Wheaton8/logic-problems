# Russian Roulette Answer with two nonadjacent bullets

### Odds with spun cylinder
The cylinder is equally likely to stop at any of the six chambers. With two 
bullets in the six chambers, the odds of being shot with a bullet are 2/6. The 
odds for survival are therefore 4/6 or about 67%.

### Odds with unspun cylinder

Because there are two bullets in the six chambers and the first shot did not 
have a bullet, the cylinder started on one of four empty chambers indicated by 
the white circles above. With the cylinder advancing one chamber, clockwise 
above, there are two initial positions in which the next chamber does not 
contain a bullet and two initial position in which the next chamber does 
contain a bullet. The odds of being shot are 2/4 and the odds of survival are 
2/4 or 50%.

**Ask to spin the cylinder.**
