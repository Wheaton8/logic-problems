# Two Guards Answer

Ask "Which path would the other guard tell me to take to get to Paradise?" and 
then go down the opposite path.

By asking one guard about the other guard, the answer will encompass both a 
truthful response and a lying response, making the answer the same regardless 
of which guard you ask. Because the answer encompasses both a truth and a lie, 
the pointed direction of Paradise will be a lie, so you go down the other path.
