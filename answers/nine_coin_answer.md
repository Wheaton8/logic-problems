# Nine Coin Answer

Yes, it is possible to identify the counterfeit coin with only two weighings on 
the balance scale. First, divide the nine coins into three sets of three coins. 
Weigh one set of three coins against another set of three coins. If the balance 
is not equal, then the counterfeit coin is in the set of three coins that is 
lighter. If the balance is equal, then the counterfeit coin is in the set of 
three coins which was not weighed. Now that we have found the set of three 
coins which contains the counterfeit coin, we move on to the second weighing 
with only these three coins and use a similar method as the first weighing. 
Again, divide the coins into three sets, in which each set now has one coin. 
Weigh one coin against another coin. If the balance is not equal, then the 
counterfeit coin is the coin which is lighter. If the balance is equal, then 
the counterfeit coin is the coin that was not weighed.
