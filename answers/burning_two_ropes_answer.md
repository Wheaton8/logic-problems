# Burning Two Ropes Answer

First, light both ends of the first rope and one end of the second rope all at 
the same time. When you light both ends of a rope, that rope will burn up in 
half the time it would take the whole rope to burn up if you had only lit one 
end of it. The first rope, in which both ends were lit, will burn up in 30 
minutes while the second rope, in which only one end was lit, will have burned 
for 30 minutes and will still have 30 minutes of burning left. At the exact 
moment when the first rope is finished burning, light the other end of the 
second rope. With fire coming from both ends now, the remaining time left on 
the second rope is cut in half. The second rope will finish burning in 15 more 
minutes. From the 30 minutes it takes to finish burning the first rope and the 
additional 15 minutes it takes to finish burning the second rope, you can 
measure exactly 45 minutes.
