# Three Hats in a Line Answer

The hat on the prisoner at the front of the line is white, which he deduces 
because the two prisoners behind him do not know the color of their own hat. 
If the prisoner at the back of the line sees two black hats, he would know that 
he has a white hat. However, the prisoner at the back of the line does not know 
the color of his hat which means that at least one of the prisoners in front of 
him has a white hat. If the prisoner in the middle sees a black hat on the 
prisoner in front of him, then he would know that his hat is the white one and 
would say so. Because the middle prisoner does not know the color of his hat, 
the color of the hat on the prisoner at the front of the line must be white.
