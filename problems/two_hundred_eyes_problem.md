# Two Hundred Eyes Problem

Two hundred wisemen with assorted eye colors live on an island. No wiseman 
knows the color of his own eyes, but each wiseman is determined to figure it 
out. The wisemen can see everyone else and can keep a count of the number of 
people they see with each eye color, but they are not allowed to talk or 
communicate in any other way to each other. Every day a ferry stops at the 
island and allows any wiseman who has figured out the color of his eyes to 
leave the island. The captain of the ferry can see that there are 100 blue-eyed 
wisemen and 100 brown-eyed wisemen, but the wisemen do not know these numbers. 
One day, let's call it day 0, as the ferry is leaving the island, the captain 
of the ferry yells back, "I can see someone who has blue eyes." *How many days 
later does the first wiseman leave, and what is his eye color?*
