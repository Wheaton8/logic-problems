# Hundred Prison Hats Problem with three colors

An executioner lines up 100 prisoners single file and randomly puts a red, 
yellow, or blue hat on each prisoner's head. Every prisoner can see the hats of 
the prisoners in front of him in line, but not his own hat nor the hats of 
those behind him in line. The executioner starts at the back of the line and 
asks the last prisoner the color of his hat. He must answer "red", "yellow", or 
"blue" and cannot change the volume, tone, speed, etc. of his answer. If he 
answers correctly he is allowed to live, but if he answers incorrectly he is 
instantly executed. On the night before the line-up, the prisoners confer on a 
stetegy to help themselves survive. *What strategy do the prisoners come up 
with to ensure maximal survival? Would it change if there were 101 prisoners or 
102 prisoners?* (HINT: It is possible to get it so that 100% of the prisoners 
survive except the first prisoner questioned in which the probability of 
survival is always 33%.)
