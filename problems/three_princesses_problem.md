# Three Princesses Problem

You are the most eligible bachelor in the kindgom, and as such, the King has 
invited you to his castle so that you may choose one of his daughters to marry. 
The oldest princess if honest and always tells the truth. The youngest princess 
is dishonest and always lies. The middle princess is mischievous and tells the 
truth somtimes and lies other times. As you will be forever married to one of 
the princesses, you want to marry either the oldest (truth-telling) or youngest 
(lying) princess because at least you will know where you stand with them. You 
can not tell the princesses apart by their appearances, but the King has 
granted you one yes/no question which may be addressed to only one princess. 
*What one yes/no question can you ask that will ensure that you do not marry 
the middle, mischievous princess?*
