# Three Hats in a Line Problem

Three prisoners are lined up single file such that the prisoner at the back can 
see the two prisoners in front of him, the prisoner in the middle can see the 
one prisoner in front of him, and the prisoner in the front cannot see anyone. 
An executioner shows the prisoners five hats: two black hats and three white 
hats. He blindfolds each prisoner, places a hat on each head, and then removes 
the blindfolds. If one prisoner states the color of his hat correctly then all 
prisoners are set free, if one prisoner states the incorrect color of his hat 
then all prisoners are executed, and if no prisoner can state the correct color 
of his hat then all prisoners simply go back to prison. The executioner starts 
at the back of the line and asks the last prisoner the color of his hat to 
which the prisoner replies "I don't know". The execution then moves to the 
middle prisoner and asks what color hat he has to which the prisoner replies 
"I don't know". The executioner then moves to the prisoner at the beginning of 
the line and asks for the color of his hat to which the prisoner correctly 
states the color of his hat. *What is the color of the prisoner's hat at the 
front of the line and how does he know?*
