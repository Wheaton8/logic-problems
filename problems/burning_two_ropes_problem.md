# Burning Two Ropes Problem

You have two ropes which each take exactly 60 minutes to burn, however the 
ropes burn at an inconsistent rate. There are spots in the rope in which it may 
burn a little faster and spots in which the rope may burn a little slower, so 
you cannot tell how much times has passed by the length of rope which has 
burned. *Using these two ropes and a lighter, how do you measure exactly 45 
minutes?*
