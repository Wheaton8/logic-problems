# Twelve Marble Problem

You have twelve marbles and a balance scale. All of the marbles look identical, 
however one marble is flawed and has a different weight than the other eleven 
marbles. You do not know if the flawed marble weighs more or less than the 
other marbles. *Is is possible to identify the flawed marble with only three 
weighings on the balance scale, and know whether the flawed marble is heavier 
or lighter than the others?*
