# Game Show Problem

You are on a game show with three doors in front of you. Behind one door is a 
fancy, new car and behind the other two are smelly, old goats. You get to pick 
a door and the host, who knows what is behind each door, opens another door 
showing a goat. You now get the option of staying with your initial door or 
switching to the one remaining door in hopes of getting the car. *Do you switch 
doors or stay?*
