# Two Guards Problem

You come to a fork in the road with one guard standing beside each fork. You 
know that one path leads to Paradise and the other path leads to Death, but you 
do not know which path is which. You also know that one guard always tells the 
truth and one guard always lies, but you do not know which guard is which. You 
are allowed to ask one question of one of the guards. *What one question do you 
ask to determine which fork leads to Paradise?*
