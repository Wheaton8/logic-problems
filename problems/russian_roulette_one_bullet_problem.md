are set free. The captor has a gun with six chambers in the cylinder. You watch 
as he puts a single bullet in the gun, closes the cylinder, and spins it. He 
puts the gun to your head and pulls the trigger. Click. Lucky you, there was no 
bullet. He asks for your say in whether or not he spins the cylinder before he
