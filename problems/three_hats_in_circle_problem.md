# Three Hats in a Circle Problem

The king is looking for an advisor and summons the three wisest men from his 
kingdom and puts them to a test. He tells them that he is about to put them in 
a room and have his aide put a hat on each of their heads. Each hat may or may 
not have a dot on it, but at least one hat will have a dot. The wise men may 
not touch the hats or communicate in any way. The first wise man to correctly 
identify whether his hat has a dot or not will become the king's advisor. If he 
is wrong or he breaks the rules, he will be killed. Then the king sends all 
three wise men into the room and tells his aide to put a dotted hat on all 
three men. After a few minutes, one of the wise men returns and proudly 
announces that he has a dot. *How did he know that he has a dot?*
