# Russian Roulette Problem with two nonadjacent bullets

You have been captured and forced to play a game of Russian roulette. The 
captor has given himself two chances to shoot you. Either you are killed or you 
are set free. The captor has a gun with six chambers in the cylinder. You watch 
as he loads two bullets into nonadjacent chambers, closes the cylinder, and 
spins it. He puts the gun to your head and pulls the trigger. Click. Lucky you, 
there was no bullet. He asks for your say in whether or not he spins the 
cylinder before he shoots for the last time. *Do you ask him to spin the 
cylinder or just pull the trigger?*
