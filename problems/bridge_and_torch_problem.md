# Bridge and Torch Problem

Four people come to a river at night. There is a narrow bridge which can only 
hold up to two people at a time. They have one torch and, because it is night, 
the torch must be used when crossing the bridge. Of the four people, person A 
can cross the bridge in 1 minute, person B in 2 minutes, person C in 5 minutes, 
and person D in 8 minutes. When two people cross the bridge together, they must 
move at the slower person's pace. _Can they all cross the bridge in 15 minutes 
or less?_
